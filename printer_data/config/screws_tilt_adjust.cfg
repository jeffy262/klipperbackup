## Bed Screw Tilt Adjust — screw coordinates the PROBE can reach

[screws_tilt_adjust]
# Notes:
#  - These positions are where the PROBE must touch. Because your probe is
#    behind the nozzle (y_offset +25), its reachable Y range is still 0..430,
#    but we must keep within the mesh box (15..415 X, 25..415 Y) for consistency.
#  - Back screws can go to Y=415 again now that y_offset is positive.

# Reference point (center mount). Useful even if it isn’t adjustable —
# other screws are reported relative to this one.
screw1: 210, 210
screw1_name: center mount (ref)

# Front row (probe Y >= 25). Your 60mm values are safe.
screw2: 40, 60
screw2_name: front left screw

screw3: 392, 62
screw3_name: front right screw

# Middle row
screw4: 392, 240
screw4_name: middle right screw

screw5: 40, 240
screw5_name: middle left screw

# Back row (stay ≤ 415 to remain inside mesh_max)
screw6: 40, 415
screw6_name: back left screw

screw7: 392, 415
screw7_name: back right screw

# Non-probing move speed during the routine (mm/s).
speed: 200

# Z clearance before/after each probe move (mm). Keep ≥ probe z_offset (2.5).
horizontal_move_z: 10

# Thread direction for M3 screws. If the UI arrow “up” makes your bed go the
# wrong way, change to CCW-M3.
